# Terrovizm

This is a project for visualizing the data from the [Global Terrorism Database](http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/):

> National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START). (2017). Global Terrorism Database [Data file]. Retrieved from https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd

It can be downloaded through the [following form](http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/contact/), even though a direct link for downlaoding the data [is available](http://apps.start.umd.edu/gtd/downloads/dataset/GTD_0617dist.zip) but not given publicly.

The [vizualization itself is hosted on Github Pages](https://gsurrel.github.io/Terrovizm/).

## To do

- [x] Create Github project and pages
- [ ] [Register the project](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc_boP3m3UtulHvia8WgLoFYemn9yEZmuq4-glNSgGfc3O2pw/viewform)
- [x] Contact the GTD to ask for permission to publicly use the viz or it stays private
- [ ] Check exactly the data available and what we keep for the Viz
- [ ] Python scriting to clean and shrink the dataset. Most textual details can probably be removed as we can give just a link to the official GTD event description and details. Scripting has the benefit of maintainability to update our dataset according to the original DB updates.
- [ ] Do all the mockups, blueprints and sketiching required
- [ ] Use this Readme as a progress report?

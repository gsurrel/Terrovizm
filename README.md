# Terrovizm

This is a project for visualizing the data from the [Global Terrorism Database](http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/):

> National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START). (2017). Global Terrorism Database [Data file]. Retrieved from https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd

It can be downloaded through the [following form](http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/contact/), even though a direct link for downlaoding the data [is available](http://apps.start.umd.edu/gtd/downloads/dataset/GTD_0617dist.zip) but not given publicly.

The [vizualization itself is hosted on Github Pages](https://gsurrel.github.io/Terrovizm/).

## To do

- [x] Create Github project and pages
- [ ] [Register the project](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc_boP3m3UtulHvia8WgLoFYemn9yEZmuq4-glNSgGfc3O2pw/viewform)
- [x] Contact the GTD to ask for permission to publicly use the viz or it stays private
- [ ] Check exactly the data available and what we keep for the Viz ([process book link](#dataset))
- [ ] Use the [deisgn worksheets](https://design-worksheets.github.io/) mentionned in the course ([process book link](#designs))
- [ ] Do all the mockups, blueprints and sketching required ([process book link](#designs))
- [ ] Python scriting to clean and shrink the dataset. Most textual details can probably be removed as we can give just a link to the official GTD event description and details. Scripting has the benefit of maintainability to update our dataset according to the original DB updates. ([process book link](#technical-setup))
- [ ] Use this Readme as a process book?
- [ ] Screencast
    - Demonstrate what you can do with your viz in a fun, engaging and impactful manner
    - Talk about your main contributions rather than on technical details
    - 2 min video not more (max +5 sec)

## Questions

*What am I trying to show this my viz?*

## Dataset

*Where does it come from, what are you processing steps?*

## Exploratory data analysis

*What viz have you used to gain insights on the data?*

## Designs

*What are the different visualizations you considered? Justify the design decisions you made using the perceptual and design principles.*

## Did you deviate from your initial proposal?

## Implementation

*Describe the intent and functionality of the interactive visualizations you implemented. Provide clear and well-referenced images showing the key design and interaction elements.*

## Technical setup



## Evaluation

*What did you learn about the data by using your visualizations? How did you answer your questions? How well does your visualization work, and how could you further improve it?*

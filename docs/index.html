            <h2>What is the data?</h2>
            <p>The Global Terrorism Database includes information on terrorist events around the world from 1970 through 2016. <a hred="https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/about/" target="_blank">More information is available on their website</a>.</p>

            <h2>Why?</h2>
            <p>
                Terrorism gets a very unequal mass-media coverage depending on the location of the act itself and how unexpected it is. Some talk about the death-kilometer score to explain the media-coverage of each event: the closer and/or more tragic an act is, the more the press talks about it. We believe that having an exhaustive overview of the terrorist acts across the world can really change the perception of terrorism and put it in perspective with its actual prevalence worldwide.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another key point is the evolution of terrorism. In our ever-more connected life, we hear about any news in a matter of hours or just minutes, thus biasing our perception and giving us the impression that it's a real and rising worldwide threat. Having the ability to see the evolution of terrorist acts since 1970 is interesting as we can see the trends and evolution with respect to the zones of conflicts and influences.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, merging these two aspects can enable anyone to explore the evolution of terrorist acts in specified zones of the world. As the database is feature-rich, we plan to implement additional tools to filer according to the different organizations and motivations.

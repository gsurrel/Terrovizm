            <h2>What is this?</h2>
            <p>
                This visualization lets you explore the details of terrorist acts. Besides the media coverage, it is hard to have a good insight of the prevalence of terrorism worldwide.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are several tools available to explore the data:
            </p>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Symbol</td>
                        <td>Meaning</td>
                        <td>Symbol</td>
                        <td>Meaning</td>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td><img src="images/cluster_example.png" style="width: 24px; height: 24px;" /></td>
                        <td>Two events happened at this place. The length of the colored crown shows the proportion of events without any casualties (one in this example). The red fraction is the proportion of killed persons, whereas the orange one the proportion of injured persons.</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            <ul>
                <li>
                     This marker contains 2 events.

            </ul>

            <h2>What is the data?</h2>
            <p>
                The Global Terrorism Database is an open-source database including information on terrorist events around the world from 1970 through 2016. The GTD includes systematic data on domestic as well as international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 170,000 cases. The criterions about inclusion in the database are the following:
            </p>
            <quote>
                <p>
                    The GTD defines a terrorist attack as the threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation. In practice this means in order to consider an incident for inclusion in the GTD, all three of the following attributes must be present:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The incident must be intentional - the result of a conscious calculation on the part of a perpetrator.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The incident must entail some level of violence or immediate threat of violence - including property violence, as well as violence against people.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The perpetrators of the incidents must be sub-national actors. The database does not include acts of state terrorism.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In addition, at least two of the following three criteria must be present for an incident to be included in the GTD:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Criterion 1: The act must be aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious, or social goal. In terms of economic goals, the exclusive pursuit of profit does not satisfy this criterion. It must involve the pursuit of more profound, systemic economic change.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Criterion 2: There must be evidence of an intention to coerce, intimidate, or convey some other message to a larger audience (or audiences) than the immediate victims. It is the act taken as a totality that is considered, irrespective if every individual involved in carrying out the act was aware of this intention. As long as any of the planners or decision-makers behind the attack intended to coerce, intimidate or publicize, the intentionality criterion is met.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Criterion 3: The action must be outside the context of legitimate warfare activities. That is, the act must be outside the parameters permitted by international humanitarian law (particularly the prohibition against deliberately targeting civilians or non-combatants).
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </quote>

            <h2>Why?</h2>
            <p>
                Terrorism gets a very unequal mass-media coverage depending on the location of the act itself and how unexpected it is. Some talk about the death-kilometer score to explain the media-coverage of each event: the closer and/or more tragic an act is, the more the press talks about it. We believe that having an exhaustive overview of the terrorist acts across the world can really change the perception of terrorism and put it in perspective with its actual prevalence worldwide.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another key point is the evolution of terrorism. In our ever-more connected life, we hear about any news in a matter of hours or just minutes, thus biasing our perception and giving us the impression that it's a real and rising worldwide threat. Having the ability to see the evolution of terrorist acts since 1970 is interesting as we can see the trends and evolution with respect to the zones of conflicts and influences.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, merging these two aspects can enable anyone to explore the evolution of terrorist acts in specified zones of the world. As the database is feature-rich, we plan to implement additional tools to filer according to the different organizations and motivations.
